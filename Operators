# C#-101

# Operators

## Objective

### In this challenge, you will work with arithmetic operators. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials and an instructional video.

## Task

### Given the meal price (base cost of a meal), tip percent (the percentage of the meal price being added as tip), and tax percent (the percentage of the meal price being added as tax) for a meal, find and print the meal's total cost. Round the result to the nearest integer.

## Example

### mealcost= 100
### tippercent= 15
### taxpercent= 8
### A tip of 15% * 100 = 15, and the taxes are 8% * 100 = 8. Print the value  and return from the function.

## Function Description

### Complete the solve function in the editor below.
### solve has the following parameters:

* int meal_cost: the cost of food before tip and tax
* int tip_percent: the tip percentage
* int tax_percent: the tax percentage
### Returns The function returns nothing. Print the calculated value, rounded to the nearest integer.

## Note:

### Be sure to use precise values for your calculations, or you may end up with an incorrectly rounded result.

## Input Format

### There are  lines of numeric input:
### The first line has a double,  (the cost of the meal before tax and tip).
### The second line has an integer,  (the percentage of  being added as tip).
### The third line has an integer,  (the percentage of  being added as tax).

## Sample Input

```
12.00
20
8
```

## Sample Output

```
15
```

## Explanation

### Given:
### meal_cost = 12, tip_percent = 20, tax_percent = 8

### Calculations:
### tip = 12 and 12/100 * 20 = 2.4
### tax = 8 and 8/100 * 20 = 0.96
### total_cost = meal_cost + tip + tax = 12+ 2.4 + 0.96 = 15.36
### round(total_cost) = 15
### We round total_cost to the nearest integer and print the result, 15.
